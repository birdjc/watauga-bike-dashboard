# watauga-bike-dashboard

Welcome to the Watauga County Bicycle Trips Dashboard. This dashboard displays the number of bicycle trips recorded on the fitness app Strava for years 2020-2022 by different spatial divisions (Census Tract, Block Group, Block) in Watauga County, North Carolina.

This is an unofficial dashboard, and is in no way sponsored by or affiliated with the Watauga County government. Bicycle trip data was provided through Strava's dataset platform, Strava Metro, which aggregates and deidentifies activities recorded on the app.

User-generated data is often the best and most representative data available for bicycling and commuting. CDC research found that Strava data correlates strongly with population-representative commuting data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) [(Whitfield et al., 2016)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6536a4.htm), and this data is important for effective demand-driven design of bicycle infrastructure networks [(Steinacker et al., 2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00318-w).

This interactive webmap was made at Appalachian State University for Web Mapping (GHY 5818, Fall 2023).

Future iterations will resolve the year selection panel, allowing the map to be updated dynamically within a single page.
